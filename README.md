# Numa RESTful API

## What?
"Numa" is derived from "pne√∫ma", meaning wind, breath, spirit. Numa's API provides functionality for sharing poetry, gathering feedback, and connecting with others.

## Why?
I'm developing Numa because I care about connecting with people; sharing expressive works with my friends and family; and having a clean, dynamic, and modern web application for sharing any form of lyrical expression.

## Okay, how do I get the server running?
* Download and install [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/download/). You can also follow [this gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) for a quick and easy way to install Node.js and npm
* Download and install [Node.js package manager](https://github.com/npm/npm).
* Download and install [MongoDB](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/) - Make sure `mongod` is running on the default port (27017).
* Install [nodemon](http://nodemon.io/): `npm install -g nodemon`
* Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/boyz-2-men/numa-restful-api.git`
* Install packages: `npm install`
* Rename pub-auth.js to auth.js in config/ and add in your own secrets.
* Launch server: `nodemon .\server.js`. 
* Visit `http://localhost:3000` or hit the endpoints using a client like the [Advanced REST Client](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-rest-client/hgmloofddffdnphfgcellkdfbfbjeloo?hl=en-US) Chrome extension

## Where can I see the documentation?
I'll be adding the RESTful API docs at [ReadMe.io](http://numa.readme.io/v1.0)
